# Web Scraping Exercises with Python
This directory contains exercises on web scraping with Python for both dynamic and static web pages. The libraries used include pandas, requests and BeautifulSoup. For the web scraping of dynamic pages, Selenium and geckodriver are used.

The steps I performed are explained in each notebook.

Note: these exercises are not for commercial purpose, but only intended as practice.
